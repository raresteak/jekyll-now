### Five w's
   Who. Well I'm raresteak.  Which doesn't really mean anything.

   Why, put this blog was put together?   Three reasons. 1. I heard on a SAN's podcast that to become a better programmer try and program at least five minutes a day.  So there's my goal, be a better Python programmer. Can I do this for at least a year? 2. Making the goal public and out there.  So with a blog up in hopes of holding myself accountable even if nobody reads at least the goal visable for me.  3. Transitioning Into Infosec https://github.com/ForgottenSec/Transitioning_Into_InfoSec/blob/master/index.md, recommends blogging what you learn.  With hopes my learning will give something back even if it's one piece of reusable code for another programmer or infosec professional.

   What.  Python, shell.    

   When. Well starting now

   Where.  Anywhere

   How.  I need some ground rules.   Does reading about programming count towards the five minutes.   Not in this instance.  It must be at least five minutes of hands on keyboard doing some kind of general programing, exercises, improving old code, or dissecting others code.
